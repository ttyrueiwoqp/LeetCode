/**
 * Created by LU-PC on 10/20/2015.
 * <p>
 * Given an array of n integers where n > 1, nums,
 * return an array output such that output[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].
 * <p>
 * Solve it without division and in O(n).
 * <p>
 * For example, given [1,2,3,4], return [24,12,8,6].
 * <p>
 * Follow up:
 * Could you solve it with constant space complexity?
 * (Note: The output array does not count as extra space for the purpose of space complexity analysis.)
