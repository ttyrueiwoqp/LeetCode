 * Created by LU-PC on 10/26/2015.
 * <p>
 * Given an array of non-negative integers, you are initially positioned
 * at the first index of the array.
 * <p>
 * Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.
 * <p>
 * Your goal is to reach the last index in the minimum number of jumps.
 * <p>
 * For example:
 * Given array A = [2,3,1,1,4]
 * <p>
 * The minimum number of jumps to reach the last index is 2.
 * (Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.)
